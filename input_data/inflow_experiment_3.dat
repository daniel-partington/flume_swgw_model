! Inflow to Flume for experiment 3
!  From the thesis of Yacine Rahai 2018
!  7 separate runs with approximately the same
!  flow rate, 15.6 L/min, study of the crosssectional
!  velocity, flow depth, infiltration
!  rate and surface velocity for the final run.
!  Determination of the friction factor for a
!  pervious sand bed.
